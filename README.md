# SuperMario
For my dissertation I recreated the first level of SuperMarioBros. This was to show competency with the tools within Unity and while programming wtih C#. Recreating the game from using the correct sprites and animation of said sprites whilst also keeping the physics as close to the original at the time.

## How to play
To play this recreation, clone the repo and run in Unity. I will also add the Unity application file so that the game can be played on demand.
